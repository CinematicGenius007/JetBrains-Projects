# About

Tired of fast food and deliveries? Sometimes, the urge to have something fancy is just too hard to beat! Let's turn to a recipe book. There's a lot of recipes in the book, and all of them are so appetizing. The search for the best recipe can take quite a while. Let's automate this to save time and a great deal of effort. Create a web service with Flask that allows storing, retrieving, updating, and deleting recipes. By creating this app, you will be able to fetch recipes in seconds. All you have to do is to choose the best recipe from the pre-uploaded list of possible recipes.
