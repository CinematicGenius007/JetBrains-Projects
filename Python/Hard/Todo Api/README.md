# About

The TODO app helps us keep track of what we need to fulfill. Build an app with CRUD functionality that can be run in your browser. It will also allow multiple users to register, log in, and create their to-do lists. 

We recommend completing other Django projects before starting this one, as the focus is mostly on the API; we expect you to have a basic understanding of Django features.

# Learning Outcomes

After completion of this project, you will understand how serializers and endpoints work. You will also get an idea of authorization and authentication in Django REST.
