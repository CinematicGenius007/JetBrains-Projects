# About

Everyone who plays videogames these days knows that they have very good visuals. It was not the case though during the early days of the industry. Many of the first videogames were text-based. "Colossal Cave Adventure" was arguably one of the most influential of them. There were no visuals, only big chunks of text, extended gameplay, a story, and the ability to save and load your progress. Use this project to create a similar text-based adventure game with a story written by you.

# Learning outcomes
