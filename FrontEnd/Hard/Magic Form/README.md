# About

Every good site has an online form to fill out â€” whether for registering, ordering food,  or making payments. Forms can be very large; if you accidentally reload a page, you can lose all the data. A sad story, isn't it? To resolve this, let's create a form that will retain the data, when it closes unexpectedly.

# Learning outcomes

In this project, you will learn the basic HTML elements for creating forms. Get to know how to handle events when interacting with these elements. Use the built-in features of the browser to save data to the local storage. Learn how to work with the DOM elements from JavaScript. Practice using arrays and functions.
